### One Page Summary

We are a deep-tech Assistive-tech startup on a mission to "be the difference" for the 1.5 billion people globally with hearing loss. In India alone, over 63 million people suffer from hearing loss yet less than 10% use hearing aids due to the combined barriers of high cost, social stigma and lack of awareness among the masses. <br /> 

To solve this we are building Able Glasses, India’s first non-surgical bone conduction smart aid glasses for individuals with hearing loss. Able Glasses use our patented bone conduction transducer that is 98% lighter in weight and 95% more power-efficient than alternatives. Able Glasses provide true smart features like 12+ hour rechargeable battery, Bluetooth connectivity, and 20-channel digital programmability for personalized hearing needs in a comfortable spectacle form-factor. To address the problem of lack of awareness we have developed Able Assistant App which serves as your personal hearing assistant. Able Assistant offers at-home hearing screenings with instant, easy to understand WHO-Grade hearing reports, an LLM-based virtual audiologist that answers users’ hearing related questions in a language they prefer and connects users to 6,000+ RCI-certified audiologists for professional hearing care. Our Able Assistant app will enable on-the-spot mass hearing screening, allowing us to identify and assist at-risk individuals, making hearing care truly accessible for all Simhastha pilgrims. 

### Able Assistant 
In the last two years of developing Able Glasses, we realised lack of awareness and acceptance of hearing loss is a major barrier. To overcome this we developed our Able Assistant app. Able Assistant app provides a simple Audiometry Screening Test, allowing anyone to check their hearing health anywhere in just three minutes using any standard smartphone and earphones. After the test, the app generates an instant, easy-to-understand audiogram report with a WHO-based hearing grade, explaining users’ hearing health profile. To provide immediate and accessible support, Able Assistant app features an LLM-based Virtual Audiologist that can answer any hearing-related questions in the users’ preferred native language. Finally, the app bridges the gap to professional care by allowing users to find and connect with 6,000+ RCI-certified audiologists across India for professional hearing care. <br /> 

Able Assistant app can be used for on-the-spot mass hearing screenings to identify and assist at-risk pilgrims, providing immediate reports and connecting them to on-site specialists for professional hearing care and creating widespread awareness, making hearing care truly accessible for the millions of Simhastha Pilgrims. 

### Able Glasses 

Able Glasses are India’s first non-surgical bone conduction smart aid glasses for individuals with hearing loss. Able Glasses feature our patented Dome Bone Conduction Transducer that are 98% lighter in weight and 95% more power-efficient than conventional alternatives, ensuring the glasses are comfortable for all-day wear. Able Glasses provide true smart features such as Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity, a 12+ hour rechargeable battery for all-day use and 16 to 20 channel digital programmability as per users’ hearing care related needs. <br /> 

As a future scope, pilgrims identified with hearing loss through the Able Assistant screening and subsequent medical diagnosis can be fitted with Able Glasses, completing the loop from early detection and intervention to full rehabilitation for Simhastha pilgrims.

### The Core Problem Being Addressed

Globally, 1.5 billion people live with hearing loss. In India alone, 63 million are affected, yet less than 10% use hearing aids. The barriers include:

* High device cost
* Deep-rooted social stigma
* Lack of awareness and timely screenings

The outcome is delayed diagnosis, lack of professional intervention, and missed opportunities for rehabilitation — leading to social isolation and reduced quality of life.
